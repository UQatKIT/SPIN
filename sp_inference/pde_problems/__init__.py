"""FEM sub-package

The pde_problem subpackage provides "classical" FEM capabilities for setting up the PDE problem for
the Bayesian inference. These structures are used for the actual inference procedure, as well as for
artificial data generation. For more detailed information, please refer to the respective modules. 

Modules:
========

1) forms:
---------
Variational form handler, **implement new use cases here**.

2) functions:
-------------
Low-level interface for transient assembly and solve

3) problems:
------------
High-level interface for general problem setup and transient assembly/solve
